# Frameworkless Basic Web Application Kata Enhancements Team UFP

This assumes you have already completed the [Basic Frameworkless Web Application](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/General_Developer/blob/master/katas/kata-frameworkless-basic-web-application/kata-frameworkless-basic-web-application.md).

You've just completed the basic frameworkless web application. Suddenly mayhem ensues as the industry begins to enter the 2000 dot com boom. Eager investors find out about your system and would like to give you millions of dollars but before they will do this they want you to add some additional features to the system.

Their requirements are as follows:

* By default your web application should just great you with your name and the date however (assume for these examples your name is Bob)  
* You should be able to add additional people to the list. For example, say you want to add Mary to your hello world, after calling the appropriate http requests it should display "Hello Bob and Mary - the time on the server is 10:59pm on 14 March 2018" _(Yes, we know that's no the late 1990's!)   
* You should then be able to add Sue to your hello world, "Hello Bob, Mary and Sue - the time on the server is 10:59pm on 14 March 2018"    
* You can also remove people from the greeting, you could remove Mary while keeping Sue , "Hello Bob & Sue - the time on the server is 11:01pm on 14 March 2018"  
* You should be able to have a custom url to get just a list of people's names without the greetings  
* You should be able to change someones name, if you have already added Sue and Sue now want's to be called Dave, you should be able to do that.  
* You can never remove yourself from the world - in this world Bob will always be there, in your world you should always be there!   
* You can also assume that everyone in your hello world has a unique name, there is only ever one Bob, one Dave, one Mary, etc.  

You can have a UI to show the state of the resource, but you donâ€™t need to worry about UI forms for adding/updating/removing people, just interact using curl or postman or your http tool of choice to send http requests to modify the state of the resource.

Oh, and of course you are still a big believer of autometed tests (this is sounding less and less like the 90's) so you need to have appropriate tests for all important logic!
